# HAUNTED FOREST (VR)

The "Haunted Forest VR" project is a 3D first-person shooter game set in a dark and
eerie forest filled with various monsters. The objective of the game is to locate and
destroy a randomly spawned object within a time limit of 60 seconds while fending off
attacks from enemies. The game was developed as a project for the “3D Modelling and
mixed reality applications” course, aiming to provide an immersive and thrilling VR
experience.

## GAME OVERVIEW

All the environment and enemy models were created by me in Blender.
